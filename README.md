# stno

stno is a one-handed steno keyboard with joysticks for my thumb. I wanted to make stno because I became obsessed with steno, didn't have an n-key roll over keyboard and i didnt want to keep arpegiating, and i wanted a one-handed keyboard like my other keyboards (all of them were too small for a steno layout). I wanted to use joysticks since i feel like holding two keys with one finger is awkward and wanted to minimize it, especially for the thumb.
