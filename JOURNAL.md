## June 19 
My goal for this project is to make use a microcontroller directly. then, after i tried making the schematic, i realized that i didn't want the process of programming to involve an external programming board (i wanted usbc programming), and i also didn't want to solder a bunch of smd chips. these two things are incompatible, so i decided if i was gonna use a microcontroller directly, i'd have to git gud at soldering smd which im currently horrible at.

Time spent: 35 minutes (didnt waste as much time as i expected to waste)

I realized my goals were a bit too ambitious and decided on an arduino nano esp32. and i started designing the schematic around that. this is also when i decided to use joysticks, specifically the hall effect ones cuz they're smooth and feel nice.

I made the PCB for the left half. (twice) the first time, i just put the key switches in the order they happened to be in, which was not at all good for the wiring, so i stopped and realized that was a horrible idea after finishing half of the wiring.

after that, i learned my lesson and spent some time positioning my components. the wiring was a lot better than last time.

Today, I'm backjournaling cuz i forgot to journal before. also, this is when i decided to reinforce the trend of my previous keyboards (they're all one handed), so i dont need a right half.

Time spent: 30 minutes

Today, I spent too much time making the case. I also learned that I could just use thicken on a surface in onshape, so I didn't have to painstakingly go through every point and move them slightly further away from the original point so that I can extrude the area in between.

then I added heatset inserts. I couldn't find a model that was the size im actually gonna use, so I just went with the one I found first. I also wanted to use l7 m3s but apparently there aren't any models for that so I just went with an l6.

Time spent: 9hr 28mins (I need to touch grass)
